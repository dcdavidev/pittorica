# Pittorica Layout Components

Documentation for each layout component:

- [Container](./components/container.md)
- [Box](./components/box.md)
- [Grid](./components/grid.md)
- [Stack](./components/stack.md)

All components use responsive units (`rem`, `vw`) and adapt to breakpoints for best results on any device.
