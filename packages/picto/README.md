# picto

**picto** is a UI framework designed as a painterly foundation for modern interfaces.

It unifies multiple design philosophies into a single, flexible toolkit.

With a rich and powerful structure that remains intentionally lightweight and easy to integrate, **picto** empowers designers and developers to create both simple components and complex, composite UIs.

> Get started quickly: import the toolkit, use the utility classes, and customize your design system with ease.
